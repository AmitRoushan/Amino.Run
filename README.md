# What is DCAP

DCAP, Distributed Cloud Application Platform, is a development platform and a runtime engine to develop and run distributed applications.

# Why we created DCAP

1. DCAP makes distributed application development super fast, easy & fun!
a) Take advantage of a wide range of [available production-ready Deployment Managers (DMs)](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/DCAP-Sapphire-Core/blob/master/docs/code_study/DMList.md).
b) DMs are functionalities that are common across many distributed applications.
c) Developers can simply plugin to their code any one of these ready-to-use DMs (rather than writing them from scratch)

2. Develop your application on DCAP once, deploy it anywhere, move it around as you wish!
a) On your local machine
b) On any cloud server
c) On any mobile phone (Android, iOS)
d) On any edge device

3. Write your application in any language of choice
a) Current DCAP release supports Java, Golang, C++ (more to come soon!)

4. DCAP covers it all
a) Sapphire (Runtime Manager), Diamond (Memory Manager), Tapir/ERIS (Storage System) and Agate (Security System)
